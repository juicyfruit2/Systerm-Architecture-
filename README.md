# Systerm-Architecture-

- Create a text file called architecture.txt. Inside, answer the following questions:
- Do some research to find real-world examples of when each architecture
pattern would be most appropriate to use. Write down your examples and
state your reasons why each pattern would be most appropriate for each
of the examples you found.
- Give two examples of systems combining two or more patterns, and
explain why you chose these examples.
